# mlx-training-rs

Rusty scripts to generate __synthetic__ data for MLX traning.

## Get started

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[you key]
mlxt --topic="Fine Tuning MLX"
```

will generate traning data for MLX, by a topic you are interested in using __knowledge distillation__(not really) by talking to GPT.
```
train.jsonl
valid.jsonl
```
